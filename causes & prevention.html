They may have low self-esteem that is led from unhelathy perceptions about body image (likely promosted by peers or social media), extreme perfectionism (which is similar to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), impulsive behavior and troubled relationships (mainly due to emotional upheaval from that troubled relationship). Depressio,  is also a lead into potential eating disorders.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-center text">Set a good example by eating well. If you live with or know someone who might be at risk for developing an eating disorder, you can help them by being a good role model. Eat regular, nutritious meals and choose healthy snacks when you get hungry between mealtimes.Other good habits to demonstrate include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating a varied diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fiber, lean protein (such as poultry breast or fish), and healthy fats (like those found in seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils).</li>
                    <li>Limiting sugary, processed, and greasy foods.</li>
                    <li>Taking time to enjoy and celebrate your meals, especially with family and friends.</li>

                <br><hr>
                <p class="card-text text-center text">Talk to your loved one about their strengths and achievements. People who have trouble separating their sense of self-worth from their physical appearance are at risk of developing eating disorders. Help them by highlighting things you appreciate about them other than their appearance and eating habits.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, you might say things like, “I love how funny and generous and hard-working you are!” or “I'm so proud of you for acing that test. All that studying is really paying off.”</li>
                    <li>Show respect for and interest in them as a person by listening actively when they talk to you. Discuss their goals, dreams, and fears in an open and non-judgmental way.</li>

                <br><hr>
                <p class="card-text text-center">Check for a family history of eating disorders. If you’re concerned that someone you know might be at risk of developing an eating disorder, try to find out if anyone else in the family has dealt with one. While it's not clear what part genetics play in the development of eating disorders, the evidence does support a hereditary element.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People who have parents or siblings with eating disorders may be at higher risk than people with no family history.</li>
