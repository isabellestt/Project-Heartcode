                    <h2 class="text-center fw-bold lh-1">Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) Nervosa</h2>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Is similar to binge eating, only that Bulimia Nervosa involves eating and purging</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Is normally a repeated cycle of binging and purging</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Is characterized by consuming a large amount of food in comparison to what an individual eats in a short period of time (binge eating) before the guilt of overeating causes the victim to engage in self induced vomiting, extreme excercising, laxative abuse and extreme fasting</p>

                <!-- Otheroxia Nervosa -->
                <div class="col-md-6 box" id="orthorexia">

                    <p class="lh-1">- Involves extreme exercise and obsession with eating what is perceived to be healthy</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Reject any food perceived as unhealthy, such as food with oil, butter, or carbohydrates</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Sometimes lead to Anorexia Nervosa, when the victims start to eliminate large number of food from their diet, for the reasons stated above</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">- Even though they are frequently mixed up, Anorexia is NOT the same as Otheroxia. The main difference is the intention, with the vicitims of Anorexia mainly seeking to lose weight while the victims of Otheroxia mainly seeking to have "clean bodies" by consuming and intaking only healthy foods.</p>
